/*
READ BEFORE EDITING. Some selectors match the same items ("hovered" selector vs non-hovered); make sure to update them in tandem.

In PR lists we can hide the meta just by acting on `max-height` + `overflow: hidden`
In Commit lists however this is not possible because they are tables, so we need to hack around `margin-bottom`

Transitions are used to delay the "hover" status so it's not too annoying when moving the mouse over a list of dimmed items.

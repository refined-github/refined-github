/*
GitHub doesn’t apply the user’s "tab size" setting in a few places, leaving the 8-character default.
This feature reduces it to 4 characters, while allowing GitHub’s own tab size setting to override it in its children.

There’s also one place where GitHub incorrectly uses the "user configuration" attribute to set it to 8, so we’re explicitly overriding that. #4833

--tab-size is used to allow the user to override it and to be picked up by `show-whitespace`

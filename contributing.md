## Notions

- You will need to be familiar with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/) and [webpack](https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/09/24/diving-webpack/) to build this extension.
- The extension can be loaded into Chrome or Firefox manually ([See notes below](#loading-into-the-browser))
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is used to create DOM elements
- All the [latest DOM APIs](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4#features) and JavaScript features are available because the extension only has to work in the latest Chrome and Firefox. ðŸŽ‰
- Each JavaScript feature lives in its own file under [`source/features`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/tree/master/source/features) and it's loaded on condition in [`source/content.js`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/source/content.js)
- Some GitHub pages are loaded via AJAX/PJAX, so some features need to be in the special `ajaxedPagesHandler` function (see it as a custom "on DOM ready")
- See what a _feature_ [looks like](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/source/features/add-time-machine-links-to-comments.js) and [how it's loaded](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/d7768508c3919558daa6b2ccc5a15aa73d081551/source/content.js#L176) (in this case it uses `observeEl` to automatically be run when new comments are loaded via AJAX)

## Workflow

First clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github
cd refined-github
npm install
```

When working on the extension or checking out branches, use this to have it constantly build your changes:

```sh
npm run watch # Listen for file changes and automatically rebuild
```

Then load or reload it into the browser to see the changes (this does not happen automatically)

## Loading into the browser

Once built, load it in the browser of your choice:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Chrome</th>
		<th>Firefox</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%">
			<ol>
				<li>Open <code>chrome://extensions</code>
				<li>Check the <strong>Developer mode</strong> checkbox
				<li>Click on the <strong>Load unpacked extension</strong> button
				<li>Select the folder <code>refined-github/distribution</code>
			</ol>
		</td>
		<td width="50%">
			<ol>
				<li>Open <code>about:debugging#addons</code>
				<li>Click on the <strong>Load Temporary Add-on</strong> button
				<li>Select the file <code>refined-github/distribution/manifest.json</code>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Firefox offers a more advanced loading technique that includes auto-reloading in the browser as well. Check-out [`web-ext run`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/web-ext_command_reference#web-ext_run).

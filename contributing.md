Suggestions and pull requests are highly encouraged!

## Notions

- You will need to be familiar with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/) and TypeScript to build this extension.
- The extension can be loaded into Chrome or Firefox manually ([See notes below](#loading-into-the-browser))
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is used to create DOM elements.
- All the [latest DOM APIs](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4#features) and JavaScript features are available because the extension only has to work in the latest Chrome and Firefox. ðŸŽ‰
- Each JavaScript feature lives in its own file under [`source/features`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/tree/master/source/features) and it's imported in [`source/refined-github.ts`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/source/refined-github.ts).
- See what a _feature_ [looks like](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/source/features/user-profile-follower-badge.tsx).
- Follow [the styleguide](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/blob/master/readme.md#L100) that appears in the Readme's source to write readable descriptions.
- Refined GitHub tries to integrate as best as possible, so [GitHub's own styleguide](https://primer.style/css) might come in useful.

## `features.add`

The simplest usage of `feature.add` is the following. This will be run instantly on all page-loads (but not on ajax loads):

```js
import * as pageDetect from 'github-url-detection';
import features from '.';

function init () {
	console.log('âœ¨');
}

features.add({
	id: __filebasename,
	description: 'Simplify the GitHub interface and adds useful features',
	screenshot: 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402241/58238638-3cbcd080-7d7a-11e9-80f6-be6c0520cfed.jpg',
}, {
	include: [
		pageDetect.isPR
	],
	waitForDomReady: false,
	init
});
```

Here's an example using all of the possible `feature.add` options:


```ts
import React from 'dom-chef';
import select from 'select-dom';
import delegate from 'delegate-it';
import * as pageDetect from 'github-url-detection';

import features from '.';

function append(event: delegate.Event<MouseEvent, HTMLButtonElement>): void {
	event.delegateTarget.after('âœ¨', <div className="rgh-jsx-element">Button clicked!</div>);
}
function init(): void {
	// Events must be set via delegate, unless shortlived
	delegate(document, '.btn', 'click', append);
}

features.add({
	id: __filebasename,
	description: 'Simplify the GitHub interface and adds useful features',
	screenshot: 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402241/58238638-3cbcd080-7d7a-11e9-80f6-be6c0520cfed.jpg',
	shortcuts: { // This only adds the shortcut to the help screen, it doesn't enable it
		'â†‘': 'Edit your last comment'
	},
}, {
	/** Whether to wait for DOM ready before runnin `init`. `false` makes `init` run right as soon as `body` is found. @default true */
	waitForDomReady: false,

	/** Rarely needed: When pressing the back button, the DOM and listeners are still there, so normally `init` isnâ€™t called again. If this is true, itâ€™s called anyway. @default false */
	repeatOnBackButton: true,
	include: [
		pageDetect.isUserProfile,
		pageDetect.isRepo
	],
	exclude: [
		pageDetect.isOwnUserProfile
	],
	init
}, {
	include: [
		pageDetect.isGist
	],
	init: () => console.log('Additional listener for gist pages!')
});
```

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 13 or later is required.

## Workflow

First clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github
cd refined-github
npm install
```

When working on the extension or checking out branches, use this to have it constantly build your changes:

```sh
npm run watch # Listen to file changes and automatically rebuild
```

Then load or reload it into the browser to see the changes.

## Loading into the browser

Once built, load it in the browser of your choice.

```sh
npm run start # Open extension in Chrome
```

```sh
npm run start:firefox # Open extension in Firefox
```

Or you can [load it manually in Chrome](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#google-chrome-opera-vivaldi) or [Firefox](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#mozilla-firefox).

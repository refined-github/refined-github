<!--
Thanks for reporting a bug! â›°

1. Make sure the bug is caused by Refined GitHub. Try disabling the extension first.
2. Include a REAL URL where the bug appears. If it happens on a private repo, find an equivalent public URL.
  DO NOT post fake URLs like github.com/<user>/<repo> unless you can't replicate it elsewhere.
3. Include a screenshot/gif so we can help you better

If we can't see the issue nor can replicate it easily, we can't help.
